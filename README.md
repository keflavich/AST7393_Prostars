AST 4930/7939: Star Formation
=============================

AKA "AST 4930/7939: Prostars", where we are in favor of stars.

The course is based on Mark Krumholz's book ["Notes on Star Formation"](https://github.com/Open-Astrophysics-Bookshelf/star_formation_notes),
[Palla & Stahler's "The Formation of Stars"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004fost.book.....S/abstract),
[Tom Megeath's course "The Secret Lives of Stars"](http://astro1.physics.utoledo.edu/~megeath/ph6820/ph6820.html),
and [Jonathan Williams Star Formation course](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/jpw/classes/star_formation/).

As usual, all credit for things that are correct go to me, and all blame is on
the reader.
