\textbf{Timing / Structure:}\\
The course will be taught primarily in person.
Class will consist of a mixture of lectures and homework.
The course will be taught largely as a classic lecture course so that we can cover a wide range of material.
Active learning will be employed when possible, but since this is my first time teaching the course,
I may be limited in how much active learning I can incorporate.

\noindent\textbf{Course Pages:} \begin{enumerate}
    \item \url{https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/}
\end{enumerate}


\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Communication:}\\
Communication will be via Canvas, Zoom, and Slack.

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:}\\
Office hours will be primarily virtual and held via Slack, with escalation to Zoom as needed.

\noindent\textbf{Main References:} %\footnotemark

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Objectives:}
You will learn the fundamentals of star formation, from gravitationl collapse
of a molecular cloud to formation of a nuclear burning core.

You will gain experience solving physical problems and developing physical insights.
You will learn about physical processes and order-of-magnitude estimation techniques.

\noindent \textbf{Course Outline:}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{5in}
\begin{flushleft}
%Chapter 1 \dotfill ~$\approx$ 3 days \\
    Learning goals of the course:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Understand the fundamentals of star formation theory and observables
        \item Practice formulating questions for research
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}
\end{minipage}

\vspace*{.15in}
\noindent\textbf{Grading Policy:}
\begin{itemize}
    %\item Labs (30\%)
    %\item Final Assignment (20\%)
    \item Class Assignments and participation, homework (70\%)
    \item Project (20\%)
    \item Final (10\%)
    %\item Final Presentation (10\%)
\end{itemize}

The late policy is 10\% credit lost per day.Â  However, I generally will give extensions if late assignments are well-justified and excused in advance.
No credit will be given for the final project if it is late.

More information on grades and grading policies is here:
\url{https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/grades.aspx}
and here

I reserve the right to curve the class such that your scores improve if the
final score distribution is lower than I expect.  This can only help your
grades; I will not apply a curve to reduce your score before the raw score.


\vspace{0.15in}
\noindent\textbf{Attendance}

Attendance is required in class. Part of your
grade for the semester is based upon class participation during the class
sessions. If you feel
that you have a situation that may allow for a make-up, contact the professor
immediately via email.


Excused absences are consistent with university policies in the graduate
catalog
(\url{https://catalog.ufl.edu/graduate/regulations/#text})
and require appropriate documentation.

%Note that much of the lab work in this course involves independently operating
%the observatory, which will require being present in person during non-class
%hours.

\noindent\textbf{Course Communication Policy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We will use Canvas for announcements and other digital communication, so
    you are expected to regularly check Canvas.

\item We may use Slack for live communication and office hours.

\item Regular attendance on zoom or in person is essential and expected.
\end{itemize}

\vskip.15in

\noindent\textbf{Students Requiring Accommodations}

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with
the UF Disability Resource Center (352.392.8565) by providing appropriate
documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter
which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodations.
Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in
the semester

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Course Evaluation}

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the
quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online
via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and
respectful manner is available at \url{https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/}.
Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete
evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas
course menu under GatorEvals, or via \url{https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/}. Summaries of
course evaluation results are available to students at
\url{https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/}.




\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Health absence / COVID policies}

We will have face-to-face instructional sessions to accomplish the student
learning objectives of this course.


\begin{itemize}
\item	You are required to wear approved face coverings at all times during
    class and within buildings.  This requirement may change over the semester.
\item	If you are experiencing any symptoms of respiratory disease (cold, flu,
    covid), please do not attend class.
\item	If you are sick, course materials will be provided to you with an
    excused absence, and you will be given a reasonable amount of time to make
    up work. Find more information in the university attendance policies.
\end{itemize}


\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Online Teaching Policy}

Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to
refer back and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students
who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are
agreeing to have their video or image recorded.  If you are unwilling to
consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your
camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute
during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.
If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you
will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using
the ``chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.
The chat will not be shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and
unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.


Students are requested, but not required, to keep their video on during Zoom meetings.
During breakout sessions and interactive work sessions held on zoom, both audio
and video participation will be required.  Students must have a functional webcam
and microphone.


\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Class Demeanor (in person)}

Students are expected to arrive to class on time and behave in a manner that is
respectful to the instructor and to fellow students. Please avoid the use of
cell phones and restrict eating to outside of the classroom. Opinions held by
other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not
contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.

\noindent\textbf{University Honesty Policy}
\nopagebreak

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, `\textit{We, the members of the
University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the
highest standards of honesty and integrity by abiding by the Student Honor
Code. On all work submitted for credit by Students at the University of
Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: âOn my honor, I
have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.â}'
The Honor Code
(\url{https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/})
specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the
possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that
facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have any
questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor or TA in this class.
